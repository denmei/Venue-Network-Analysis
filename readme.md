# Venue Network Analysis

Understanding why Treatwell users choose particular salons is crucial to optimize different aspects of our web appearance. There are many factors a user could consider before booking with a particular salon: treatment type, price, location and the salon's rating are just a few examples. The question is, which of all these factors are the most important ones.

A possible approach to answer this question is looking at the venues' customer circles. We can assume that a user always has the same priorities when picking a new salon. Hence salons with overlapping customer circles should share these attributes that are so important to their clienteles. Accordingly, clustering venues with similar customs and checking for shared attributes will give us an idea about what made these customers choose these salons.

This notebook produces transforms builds the network of Treatwell's salons in London, using historic venue and order data. The table can then be loaded into Gephi, which allows visualizing and exploring the network.
